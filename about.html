        Our Company Sports Central was founded by Dennis Krupitsky in 2018, and is currently an online only store, but have plans to open stores in major cities like New York, California, and Chicago, within the next few years. Our goal is to become the number 1 sports apperal store in America as we are dedicated to selling sports apperal to all kinds of sports fans, whether you are a Rangers fan, Cubs fan, or even a Lakers fan. Our main store feature, is that we have top sports analysts and writers who watch, track, and examine every game in every sport, and through their analysis we determine the players of the week and teams of the week within different sports, and then feature their jerseys, shirts, sweatshirts, etc. As we are just starting out, our collection is not nearly as big as it will become in coming months, so stay tuned, as Sports Central embarks on our journey.
